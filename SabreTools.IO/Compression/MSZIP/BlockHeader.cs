    /// Each MSZIP block is the result of a single deflate compression operation, as defined in [RFC1951].

    /// blocks, as defined in [RFC1951]. The number, deflation mode, and type of RFC 1951 blocks in each
    /// MSZIP block is determined by the compressor, as defined in [RFC1951]. The last RFC 1951 block in
    /// each MSZIP block MUST be marked as the "end" of the stream(1), as defined by [RFC1951]
    /// section 3.2.3. Decoding trees MUST be discarded after each RFC 1951 block, but the history buffer
    /// MUST be maintained.Each MSZIP block MUST represent no more than 32 KB of uncompressed data.
    /// 
    /// The maximum compressed size of each MSZIP block is 32 KB + 12 bytes. This enables the MSZIP

    /// has a value of BTYPE = 00.
