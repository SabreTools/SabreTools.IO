# SabreTools.IO

This library comprises I/O functionality for the following file types:

- ClrMamePro-derived Metadata files
- Standard and non-standard INI files
- Separated-Value files (e.g. CSV, SSV, TSV)

There are also some extensions that are useful for wrapping common functionality required by SabreTools.
